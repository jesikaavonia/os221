What I've learn from 2 weeks in OS:

## 1. Re-Installing stuff and start it all again from step 1 faster than debugging your thing.
Disclaimer applied to small scale of project or newbie level, like me, ~~and you~~.
I learn from my mistakes and enjoy the pain, i mean the progress.

## 2. Do not sistem kebut semalam.
Eventho this one kinda fun, jangan deh.

## 3. Not really sure in the end of the semester I will end this class or this class wil end me.
