What I've learn from 2 weeks in OS:
<br>

### WEEK 02

1. Re-Installing stuff and start it all again from step 1 faster than debugging your thing.
Disclaimer applied to small scale of project or newbie level, like me, ~~and you~~.
I learn from my mistakes and enjoy the pain, i mean the progress.

2. Do not sistem kebut semalam.
Eventho this one kinda fun, jangan deh.

3. Not really sure in the end of the semester I will end this class or this class wil end me.
sheeshhh, stream nct dream

### WEEK 09
Been so hard for me but just go GSGS bro everything is out there on google and do ask friends. Even if you think you're not close enough to ask stuff as friends, just ask them as classmates, you'll be friend through this project I promise.
I really went here and there to found a way to solve my problem, I once read stuff from CS UNI in China, and it works, somehow.
